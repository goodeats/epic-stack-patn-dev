### 1. List Page: `about.index.tsx`

- **Purpose:** Main dashboard for About Me sections and categories.
- **Features:**
  - Lists all About Me sections and categories for the user.
  - Provides filtering and sorting.
  - Opens the category editor dialog for create/edit.
- **Data Loading:** Loader fetches all sections and categories.
- **Actions:** Handles category CRUD via `handleCategoryAction` (imported from `__about-category-editor.server.tsx`).

#### Data Table Features

The About Me dashboard list page displays two data tables:

- **About Me Sections Table**
- **About Me Categories Table**

Both tables are built with the following interactive features:

##### About Me Sections Table

- **Filtering:**
  - By content
  - By category
- **Switch Form:**
  - Toggle published status for each section using a switch component. This submits a form to update the status immediately.
- **Menu-Driven Actions:**
  - Edit: Navigates to the edit page for the selected section.
  - Delete: Submits a form to delete the section, with a confirmation prompt.
- **Row Link:**
  - The section name is a link to the details page for that section.

##### About Me Categories Table

- **Filtering:**
  - By name
  - By description
- **Switch Form:**
  - Toggle published status for each category using a switch component. This submits a form to update the status immediately.
- **Menu-Driven Actions:**
  - Edit: Opens a dialog for editing the selected category.
  - Delete: Submits a form to delete the category, with a confirmation prompt.
- **Dialog-Driven Editing:**
  - Creating or editing a category opens a modal dialog with the category editor form.

##### Data Table Features Summary

| Table                    | Filtering Fields         | Switch (Publish) | Menu Actions (Edit/Delete) | Edit Method         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| About Me Sections       | Content, Category       | Yes              | Edit (link), Delete       | Edit page           |
| About Me Categories     | Name, Description       | Yes              | Edit (dialog), Delete     | Dialog (modal form) |

These features provide a rich, interactive experience for managing both About Me sections and their categories directly from the dashboard list page.

## Best Practices

- **Colocation:** Editor components and server logic are colocated with route files for maintainability.
- **Reusability:** Shared editor components are used across new/edit pages and dialogs.
- **Type Safety:** Types are imported from `+types` files for strong typing (not shown in this tree).
- **Separation of Concerns:** UI, data loading, and server actions are clearly separated.

## Notes

- All About Me section and category CRUD operations are handled via forms and server actions, not client-side state.
- The structure supports easy extension for new features (e.g., more fields, validation, or additional routes).
